This is directly mentioned in the pre-text of the context.\n\n2. **Rental Expenses for 2003**: The context table provides future minimum lease commitments, but it does not specify the exact rental expense for 2003. However, it indicates a commitment of $30 million for total operations in 2003. Since the question asks for rental expenses specifically for continuing operations, and the context does not provide a breakdown for continuing versus discontinued operations for 2003, I cannot definitively state the rental expense for 2003.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I can provide the rental expense for 2002 but not for 2003 due to lack of specific information.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"Rental expense for 2002 is $31 million; Rental expense for 2003 is unknown\"; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"middle\"]."

This indicates that the threshold for the performance pool was set at 30% for the period starting in 2005.\n\n2. **2006 Long-Term Outperformance Compensation Program**: The context states that the performance criteria under this plan were not met, and therefore, no LTIP units were earned. However, it does not specify a threshold for this program, indicating that it may not have been established or achieved.\n\n3. **2003 Long-Term Outperformance Compensation Program**: This program had a threshold of a total return in excess of 40% over a 48-month period starting April 1, 2003. However, this is not directly related to the years 2006 and 2007.\n\nFrom the analysis, it appears that the only specific threshold mentioned for the years relevant to the question is the 30% threshold from the 2005 program.

The effective tax expense (benefit) rate for 2017 is indicated in the table as (60.8)%. This means that the company had a tax benefit rather than an expense, which is a result of the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities due to the 2017 tax act.\n\nThe statutory U.S. federal tax rate for 2017 was 35.0%. The effective tax rate being significantly lower than the statutory rate indicates that the company benefited from the tax reforms, particularly the reduction in the corporate tax rate and the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities.\n\nTo calculate the gross amount of the recognized tax benefit, we can use the effective tax rate and the income before tax. However, the context does not provide the income before tax figure directly. Instead, it states that the company recognized a net tax benefit of $2.6 billion, which was recorded as a reduction to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nThus, the effective tax rate for 2017 is (60.8)%, and it is significantly lower than the statutory tax rate of 35.0%.

            "raw_answer": "To find the net interest income reported in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year 2016, I will refer to the provided context. \n\nIn the context, it states that \"net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $ 2.93 billion for 2017, 13% (13%) higher than 2016.\" This indicates that the net interest income for 2016 can be calculated by taking the 2017 figure and adjusting for the 13% increase.\n\nLet’s calculate it step by step:\n\n1. The net interest income for 2017 is $2.93 billion.\n2. Since this amount is 13% higher than the 2016 amount, we can denote the 2016 net interest income as X.\n3. Therefore, we can set up the equation: \n   \\[\n   2.93 = X + 0.13X\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2.93 = 1.13X\n   \\]\n4. To find X, we divide both sides by 1.13:\n   \\[\n   X = \\frac{2.93}{1.13} \\approx 2.59 \\text{ billion}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the net interest income reported in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year 2016 is approximately $2.59 billion.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"2.59 billion\"; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."

For international plans, the expected return rates varied between 3.00% and 8.25%. This indicates that the expected return rate is a key factor in determining the financial performance of the pension plans.\n\n2. **Total Value of Plan Assets**: The context provides information about the asset allocation of the U.S. qualified plan as of June 30, 2008, which was approximately 40% equity investments, 42% debt securities, and 18% other investments. However, it does not provide the total dollar value of the plan assets directly.\n\n3. **Correlation**: The expected return rate is used to project the future performance of the plan assets. The context mentions that the actual negative return on assets was $19.3 million compared to the expected return of $47.0 million, leading to a net deferred loss of $66.3 million. This indicates that the expected return rate is crucial for assessing the performance of the plan assets, as it sets a benchmark against which actual returns are measured.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can conclude that the expected return rate on plan assets for fiscal 2008 was 7.75% for the U.S. qualified plan, and it is directly correlated with the performance of the plan assets, as it influences the financial outcomes reported.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"The expected return rate on plan assets for fiscal 2008 was 7.75% for the U.S. qualified plan, and it correlates with the performance of the plan assets as it sets a benchmark for expected financial outcomes.\"; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."

The context mentions that the company exchanged all of its $250.0 million floating rate notes due 2008 for $250.0 million aggregate principal amount floating rate notes due 2010.

This indicates that the recognition of revenue may not align with cash received due to the estimation of uncollectible accounts (allowances for doubtful accounts).\n\n2. **Impairment of Receivables**: It is stated that a receivable is considered impaired when it is probable that amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms. This impairment can lead to discrepancies as revenue may be recognized when the sale occurs, but cash may not be received if the receivable is impaired.\n\n3. **Charge-offs and Allowances**: The context explains that amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances, which affects the revenue recognized. If a company recognizes revenue but later charges off a receivable, this creates a discrepancy between cash received and recognized revenue.\n\n4. **Timing of Charge-offs**: The timing of charge-offs for finance and contract receivables is also relevant. For example, accounts that are 120 days past due are assessed for charge-off, which means that revenue may have been recognized earlier than when cash is actually received.\n\n5. **Accrued Liabilities**: The context also discusses accrued liabilities, which can indicate expenses that have been recognized but not yet paid. This can further contribute to discrepancies between cash flow and revenue recognition.\n\nBased on these points, the factors contributing to discrepancies include:\n- Allowances for doubtful accounts affecting revenue recognition.\n- Impairment of receivables leading to adjustments in recognized revenue.\n- Timing differences in charge-offs for receivables.\n- Accrued liabilities that may not align with cash payments.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"Factors include allowances for doubtful accounts, impairment of receivables, timing of charge-offs, and accrued liabilities.\"; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."

The increase in berths is:\n\nIncrease in berths = Total berths by end of 2021 - Existing berths (end of 2016)\nIncrease in berths = 676,000 - 503,000 = 173,000\n\nThus, by the end of 2021, there will be a total of 676,000 berths, which is an increase of 173,000 berths compared to the end of 2016.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"676,000 berths; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."
