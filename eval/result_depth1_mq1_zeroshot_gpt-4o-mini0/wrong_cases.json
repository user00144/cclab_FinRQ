The 2005 plan had a maximum performance pool of $49,250,000 established in June 2006. The 2006 plan did not have any ltip units earned, indicating no performance pool was established for that year.\n\n2. **Focus on the 2005 Plan**: The 2005 outperformance plan is the only one that established a performance pool during the specified timeframe. The maximum performance pool of $49,250,000 was determined in June 2006, which falls within the period of interest (2006).\n\n3. **Consider the 2006 Plan**: The 2006 plan did not yield any ltip units, meaning there was no additional performance pool created in 2007.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the only relevant performance pool established during the specified period was the $49,250,000 from the 2005 plan in June 2006, this is the amount that the compensation committee put into the maximum performance pool between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2007.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"49.25 million\";]."
