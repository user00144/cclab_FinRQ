Let’s denote the revenue ton-miles in 2010 as \\( R_{2010} \\). We need to find \\( R_{2011} \\) without the increase in carloads and mix changes.\n2. Since revenue ton-miles increased by 9% in 2010, we can express this as:\n   \\[\n   R_{2010} = R_{2009} \\times (1 + 0.09)\n   \\]\n3.

To find the revenue ton-miles without the increase in carloads and mix changes, we need to remove the effect of the 3% increase in carloads from the 5% increase in revenue ton-miles. We can assume that the increase in revenue ton-miles is directly proportional to the increase in carloads.\n5.
