In 2003, the company had 1,937,141 shares issued. However, we need to focus on the number of shares before the reverse stock split.\n\n2. **Reverse Stock Split**: The reverse stock split was a one-for-three split, meaning that for every three shares of common stock, one share would be issued post-split. This indicates that the total number of shares would be reduced by a factor of three.\n\n3. **Calculating Pre-Split Shares**: Since the context does not provide the total number of shares outstanding before the split directly, we can infer that the shares issued to employees (1,939,734 in 2004) would be part of the total outstanding shares. However, we do not have the complete number of shares outstanding before the split.\n\n4. **Effect of the Reverse Stock Split**: After the one-for-three reverse stock split, the total number of shares would be divided by three. Therefore, if we assume the total number of shares outstanding before the split was X, after the split it would be X/3.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit information on the total number of common shares outstanding before the reverse stock split, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the total number of common shares issued and outstanding before the split.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"Insufficient information to determine the total number of common shares issued and outstanding before the reverse stock split\"; Used hints: \"9\"; Confidence: \"low\"]."

This decrease was attributed to lower net sales from air and missile defense programs and various other programs, which were partially offset by increases in tactical missiles and fire control programs.\n\n2. **Operating Profit**: The operating profit in 2016 decreased by $264 million, or 21%, compared to 2015. This decline in operating profit was primarily due to lower risk retirements in air and missile defense programs, tactical missiles, and fire control programs.\n\n3. **Operating Expenses**: The context mentions that adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and reserves, were about $225 million lower in 2016 compared to 2015. This suggests that operating expenses may have been impacted by these adjustments, contributing to the overall decrease in operating profit.\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that the decrease in net sales directly contributed to the decline in operating profit, as lower sales typically lead to reduced revenue, which in turn affects profit margins. Additionally, the adjustments in operating expenses also played a role in the overall financial performance.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"The relationship indicates that a decrease in net sales negatively impacted operating profit, which was further influenced by adjustments in operating expenses.\"; Used hints: \"1\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."

The total additions for tax positions taken in the current year and prior fiscal years for 2018 were $21.1 million (as per the hint).\n\nNow, we can summarize the additions:\n- Additions for current year: $3.1 million\n- Additions for prior years: $18.0 million\n- Total additions: $21.1 million\n\nNext, we need to consider the reductions that occurred during the fiscal year 2018:\n- Reductions for tax positions taken in prior fiscal years: -$5.3 million\n- Reductions due to settlement: -$29.4 million\n- Reductions for currency translation adjustments: -$9.6 million\n- Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations: -$2.0 million\n\nNow, we can calculate the total reductions:\nTotal reductions = -$5.3 million - $29.4 million - $9.6 million - $2.0 million = -$46.3 million\n\nFinally, we can calculate the ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits for 2018:\nEnding balance = Beginning balance + Total additions + Total reductions\nEnding balance = $148.9 million + $21.1 million - $46.3 million\nEnding balance = $123.7 million\n\nHowever, the ending balance reported in the context is $127.1 million. This indicates that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would be added to the ending balance for 2018 is the total additions of $21.1 million.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would be added to the ending balance for 2018 is $21.1 million. \n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"21.1 million\"; Used hints: \"1\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."

It specifies that the company purchased 800 communications sites initially and then 700 more, totaling 1500.\n3. Additionally, the context mentions that the agreement was amended to allow for the acquisition of up to an additional 300 communications sites, subject to regulatory approval.\n4.

The effective income tax rate for 2018 is stated as 17%.\n2. The gain on the sale of ownership interests in discontinued operations is mentioned as $2.6 billion, with an after-tax amount of $2.2 billion.\n\nTo find the effective income tax rate applied to the gain, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Effective Tax Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Tax Amount}}{\\text{Pre-Tax Gain}} \\times 100\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- The pre-tax gain is $2.6 billion.\n- The after-tax gain is $2.2 billion, which means the tax amount is $2.6 billion - $2.2 billion = $0.4 billion.\n\nNow, substituting the values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Effective Tax Rate} = \\frac{0.4 \\text{ billion}}{2.6 \\text{ billion}} \\times 100 \\approx 15.38\\%\n\\]\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that this tax rate is the same as the effective income tax rate of 17% for the year 2018. Therefore, while we can calculate an effective tax rate based on the gain, we cannot definitively conclude that it is the same as the stated effective income tax rate without additional context.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nThe effective income tax rate applied to the gain on the sale of ownership interests in discontinued operations is approximately 15.38%, but it is not explicitly stated in the context. \n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"Approximately 15.38%\"; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"middle\"]."

However, we need to isolate the revenue-ton-miles from the effects of the 3% increase in carloads and the changes in commodity mix.\n\nThe revenue-ton-miles for 2010 can be inferred from the context, where it states that gross and revenue-ton-miles increased by 10% and 9%, respectively, in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a 13% increase in carloads. \n\nTo find the revenue-ton-miles for 2011 without the 3% increase in carloads, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the revenue-ton-miles for 2010**: Since the revenue-ton-miles increased by 9% in 2010 compared to 2009, we can denote the revenue-ton-miles for 2009 as R. Therefore, the revenue-ton-miles for 2010 would be R * 1.09.\n\n2. **Calculate the revenue-ton-miles for 2011**: The revenue-ton-miles for 2011 increased by 5% compared to 2010. Thus, the revenue-ton-miles for 2011 would be (R * 1.09) * 1.05.\n\n3. **Remove the impact of the 3% increase in carloads**: To isolate the revenue-ton-miles without the 3% increase in carloads, we need to adjust the 2011 revenue-ton-miles back to what it would have been without that increase. This means we need to calculate what the revenue-ton-miles would have been if the increase in carloads had not occurred.\n\nHowever, the context does not provide a specific numerical value for revenue-ton-miles in 2010 or 2009, making it impossible to calculate the exact revenue-ton-miles for 2011 without the 3% increase in carloads.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I cannot determine the exact revenue-ton-miles for 2011 without considering the 3% increase in carloads and the changes in commodity mix.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"Cannot determine exact revenue-ton-miles\"; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"low\"]."

The total unrecognized tax benefits for Alcoa in 2013 and 2014 were $98, as indicated in the hint (1).\n\nNext, we need to analyze the settlements with tax authorities for those years. According to the context, the settlements with tax authorities were as follows:\n- For 2013: -$8\n- For 2014: -$29\n\nNow, we can calculate the settlements as a percentage of the total unrecognized tax benefits (which we are using as a proxy for tax liabilities) for each year:\n\n1. **For 2013:**\n   - Total unrecognized tax benefits: $66 (beginning balance) + $2 (current year addition) + $11 (prior years addition) - $2 (reductions) - $8 (settlements) - $2 (expiration) - $4 (foreign currency) = $66\n   - Settlement: -$8\n   - Percentage: (-$8 / $66) * 100 = -12.12%\n\n2. **For 2014:**\n   - Total unrecognized tax benefits: $63 (beginning balance) + $2 (current year addition) + $5 (prior years addition) - $4 (reductions) - $29 (settlements) - $0 (expiration) - $2 (foreign currency) = $35\n   - Settlement: -$29\n   - Percentage: (-$29 / $35) * 100 = -82.86%\n\nThus, the total tax liabilities for Alcoa in 2013 and 2014 are $66 and $35, respectively.

This is a fundamental reason for discrepancies, as cash may be received later than the revenue is recognized.\n\n2. **Impairment of Receivables**: The context states that a receivable is considered impaired when it is probable that all amounts related to it will not be collected according to the contractual terms. If receivables become impaired, this can lead to a reduction in recognized revenue, as the company may need to adjust its allowances for doubtful accounts.\n\n3. **Charge-offs**: The context explains that amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances. This means that if a receivable is charged off, it will not contribute to cash collections, leading to discrepancies between cash received and revenue recognized.\n\n4. **Recovery of Previously Charged-off Accounts**: The context also mentions that amounts recovered on previously charged-off accounts increase the allowances. This indicates that there can be fluctuations in cash collections based on recoveries, which can further complicate the relationship between cash received and revenue recognized.\n\nBased on these points, the factors contributing to discrepancies include the timing of revenue recognition, the impairment of receivables, charge-offs, and recoveries of previously charged-off accounts.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"The discrepancies between cash payments received from clients and the revenue recognized in the financial statements are primarily due to the timing of revenue recognition at the point of sale, impairment of receivables, charge-offs for uncollectible amounts, and recoveries of previously charged-off accounts.\"; Used hints: \"1\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."
