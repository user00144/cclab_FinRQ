The hints suggest we need to focus on the shares issued and the impact of the reverse stock split.\n\n### Step 3: Define Atomic Operations\n1. **Identify the number of shares issued to employees in 2004**: \n   - Shares issued = 1,939,734\n2. **Account for the reverse stock split**: \n   - Since the reverse stock split was one-for-three, we need to adjust the number of shares accordingly.\n   - The number of shares after the reverse stock split = Shares issued / 3\n   - Calculation: 1,939,734 / 3 = 646,578 (rounded down to the nearest whole number, as shares cannot be fractional).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Outstanding Shares\nSince the context does not provide any additional information about other shares outstanding or any shares that may have been repurchased or canceled, we will assume that the shares issued to employees are the only shares outstanding for this calculation.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe total number of shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2004, is 646,578.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"646578\"]."

        "log": "To answer the question regarding what percent hard assets are of the net assets acquired for the Can and Alcan acquisitions, we will follow a step-by-step approach.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Domain Facts\nHard assets typically refer to tangible assets such as property, plant, and equipment. In this context, we will consider the following hard assets from the table:\n- Property, Plant, and Equipment\n- Cash (though it is not a physical asset, it is often included in the calculation of total assets)\n\n### Step 2: Translate Table Data into Sentences\nFrom the table, we have the following values for hard assets:\n- For U.S. Can:\n  - Cash: $0.2 million\n  - Property, Plant, and Equipment: $165.7 million\n- For Alcan:\n  - Cash: $2013 million\n  - Property, Plant, and Equipment: $73.8 million\n\nThe total net assets acquired for both acquisitions are:\n- U.S. Can: $617.9 million\n- Alcan: $184.7 million\n\n### Step 3: Define Atomic Operations\n1. Calculate total hard assets for U.S. Can:\n   - Hard Assets (U.S. Can) = Cash + Property, Plant, and Equipment\n   - Hard Assets (U.S. Can) = $0.2 million + $165.7 million = $165.9 million\n\n2. Calculate total hard assets for Alcan:\n   - Hard Assets (Alcan) = Cash + Property, Plant, and Equipment\n   - Hard Assets (Alcan) = $2013 million + $73.8 million = $2086.8 million\n\n3. Calculate total net assets for both acquisitions:\n   - Total Net Assets = U.S. Can Net Assets + Alcan Net Assets\n   - Total Net Assets = $617.9 million + $184.7 million = $802.6 million\n\n4. Calculate the percentage of hard assets for U.S. Can:\n   - Percentage Hard Assets (U.S. Can) = (Hard Assets (U.S. Can) / U.S. Can Net Assets) * 100\n   - Percentage Hard Assets (U.S. Can) = ($165.9 million / $617.9 million) * 100 ≈ 26.87%\n\n5. Calculate the percentage of hard assets for Alcan:\n   - Percentage Hard Assets (Alcan) = (Hard Assets (Alcan) / Alcan Net Assets) * 100\n   - Percentage Hard Assets (Alcan) = ($2086.8 million / $184.7 million) * 100 ≈ 1120.56%\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe percentages of hard assets relative to net assets acquired for the U.S. Can and Alcan acquisitions are approximately 26.87% and 1120.56%, respectively. \n\nHowever, since the question asks for the percentage of hard assets of net assets acquired for both acquisitions combined, we will calculate that as follows:\n\n- Total Hard Assets = Hard Assets (U.S. Can) + Hard Assets (Alcan)\n- Total Hard Assets = $165.9 million + $2086.8 million = $2252.7 million\n\n- Total Net Assets = $802.6 million (as calculated earlier)\n\n- Percentage of Hard Assets of Total Net Assets = (Total Hard Assets / Total Net Assets) * 100\n- Percentage of Hard Assets of Total Net Assets = ($2252.7 million / $802.6 million) * 100 ≈ 280.73%\n\nThus, the final answer is:\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"280.73%\"]."

The relevant information from the context is:\n- The board authorized the purchase of up to 50 million shares.\n- As of December 31, 2012, there were 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase.\n- We also need to know the total outstanding shares to calculate the ratio.\n\n### Step 2: Translate Table Data and Hints\nThe hints provided do not give us the total number of outstanding shares directly. However, we know:\n- The company had authorized repurchase of 50 million shares.\n- After repurchasing 1 million shares, the remaining authorization is 24 million shares.\n\nThis means that the company has repurchased a total of:\n- 50 million (initial authorization) - 24 million (remaining authorization) = 26 million shares repurchased.\n\n### Step 3: Define Atomic Operations\nTo find the ratio, we need to calculate the percentage of the outstanding shares that the remaining authorized repurchase represents. We will assume that the total outstanding shares are the initial authorized shares minus the repurchased shares.\n\n1. Calculate the total outstanding shares:\n   - Total outstanding shares = Initial authorization - Shares repurchased\n   - Total outstanding shares = 50 million - 26 million = 24 million shares.\n\n2. Calculate the ratio of the remaining authorized shares to the total outstanding shares:\n   - Ratio = Remaining authorized shares / Total outstanding shares\n   - Ratio = 24 million / 24 million = 1.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe ratio of the percent of the outstanding shares of the authorized repurchase of the company common stock as of December 2012 is 1, which means that the remaining authorized shares are equal to the total outstanding shares.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"1\";]."

Specifically, we are looking for the unrealized losses in 2006 and how much of that was offset by foreign currency translation.\n\n### Step 2: Translate Table Data and Identify Gold Evidence\nFrom the provided table data for 2006:\n- **Foreign currency translation**: $197 million (this is a gain)\n- **Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities**: -$227 million\n- **Total unrealized losses**: This includes various components, but we will focus on the unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities for our calculation.\n\n### Step 3: Define Atomic Operations\n1. Identify the unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities: \n   - \\( \\text{Unrealized Loss} = 227 \\) million (absolute value)\n2. Identify the foreign currency translation gain:\n   - \\( \\text{Foreign Currency Translation} = 197 \\) million\n3. Calculate the net unrealized loss after considering the foreign currency translation:\n   - \\( \\text{Net Unrealized Loss} = \\text{Unrealized Loss} - \\text{Foreign Currency Translation} \\)\n   - \\( \\text{Net Unrealized Loss} = 227 - 197 = 30 \\) million\n4. Calculate the percentage of unrealized loss offset by foreign currency translation:\n   - \\( \\text{Percentage Offset} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Foreign Currency Translation}}{\\text{Unrealized Loss}} \\right) \\times 100 \\)\n   - \\( \\text{Percentage Offset} = \\left( \\frac{197}{227} \\right) \\times 100 \\)\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Calculations\n1. Calculate the percentage offset:\n   - \\( \\text{Percentage Offset} = \\left( \\frac{197}{227} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 86.8\\% \\)\n\n### Conclusion\nThe foreign currency translation gain of $197 million offset approximately 86.8% of the unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities of $227 million in 2006.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"86.8%\"]."

The information about preferred stock issuance and its impact on net income does not provide a clear path to determine the amount spent on share repurchases.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of explicit information regarding the amount spent on repurchasing shares of common stock in 2008, I cannot provide a definitive answer. The data provided does not include any figures or references to share repurchases.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"Insufficient information to determine the amount spent on share repurchases in 2008.\"];"

However, since the old notes were replaced with new notes of the same amount, the increase in long-term debt is effectively zero from this transaction alone.\n   - Therefore, we need to consider the total long-term debt before and after the issuance of the new notes. Since the old notes were redeemed and replaced with new notes of the same amount, the total long-term debt remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Calculate Percent Increase**:\n   - Since the total long-term debt remains the same, the percent increase can be calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percent Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Debt} - \\text{Old Debt}}{\\text{Old Debt}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Here, both the new and old debt amounts are $250.0 million, so:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percent Increase} = \\left( \\frac{250.0 - 250.0}{250.0} \\right) \\times 100 = 0\\%\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The floating rate notes maturing in 2010 do not result in an increase in long-term debt since they replaced existing debt of the same amount.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"0%\"]."

We need to determine the percentage of owned routes in relation to the total routes.\n\n### Step 2: Translate Table Data and Hints\nFrom the table, we have the following data for 2006:\n- Main line route miles: 27,318\n- Branch line route miles: 5,021\n- Total route miles (main line + branch line): 27,318 + 5,021 = 32,339\n\nThe company owns 26,466 route miles in total, but we need to determine how much of that is specifically for the main line and branch line.\n\n### Step 3: Define Atomic Operations\n1. Calculate the total route miles for main line and branch line:\n   - Total route miles = Main line + Branch line = 27,318 + 5,021 = 32,339\n2. Calculate the percentage of owned main line routes:\n   - Owned main line percentage = (Owned main line miles / Total main line miles) * 100\n3. Calculate the percentage of owned branch line routes:\n   - Owned branch line percentage = (Owned branch line miles / Total branch line miles) * 100\n\n### Step 4: Perform Calculations\nAssuming the owned route miles are distributed proportionally (since we don't have specific owned miles for main and branch lines), we can calculate the percentages based on the total owned miles.\n\n1. **Calculate the percentage of owned main line routes:**\n   - Owned main line percentage = (Owned main line miles / Total main line miles) * 100\n   - Let's assume the owned miles are distributed based on the ratio of main line to total:\n   - Ratio of main line = 27,318 / 32,339\n   - Owned main line miles = 26,466 * (27,318 / 32,339) = 22,000 (approx)\n   - Owned main line percentage = (22,000 / 27,318) * 100 ≈ 80.5%\n\n2. **Calculate the percentage of owned branch line routes:**\n   - Owned branch line percentage = (Owned branch line miles / Total branch line miles) * 100\n   - Ratio of branch line = 5,021 / 32,339\n   - Owned branch line miles = 26,466 * (5,021 / 32,339) = 4,466 (approx)\n   - Owned branch line percentage = (4,466 / 5,021) * 100 ≈ 89.0%\n\n### Conclusion\nThe percentages of owned routes are approximately:\n- Main line: 80.5%\n- Branch line: 89.0%\n\nThus, the final answer is:\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"Main line owned percentage: 80.5%; Branch line owned percentage: 89.0%\"]."

We know that revenue ton-miles increased by 5% in 2011 compared to 2010, driven by a 3% increase in carloads and changes in the mix of commodities.\n\n### Step 2: Translate Table Data and Hints\nFrom the context, we have the following relevant data:\n- Revenue ton-miles increased by 5% in 2011 compared to 2010.\n- The increase was driven by a 3% increase in carloads and changes in the mix of heavier commodities.\n\n### Step 3: Define Atomic Operations\n1.

Subtract Other:\n   - New Liability = New Liability - Other\n   - New Liability = New Liability - $1,743\n\n5. Finally, compare the New Liability to the Liability at the end of 2006:\n   - Liability at the end of 2006 = $7,327\n\n### Step 4: Perform Calculations\n1. Calculate New Liability after adding the expense:\n   - New Liability = $20,963 + $496 = $21,459\n\n2. Subtract the cash payments:\n   - New Liability = $21,459 - $12,389 = $9,070\n\n3. Subtract Other:\n   - New Liability = $9,070 - $1,743 = $7,327\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculations confirm that the liability at the end of 2006 is indeed $7,327 (in thousands), which matches the provided data. \n\nNow, to find the net change in the balance of liability related to employee separations during 2005, we can calculate:\n- Net Change = Liability at the end of 2006 - Liability at the end of 2005\n- Net Change = $7,327 - $20,963 = -$13,636 (in thousands)\n\nThus, the net change in the balance of liability related to employee separations during 2005 is a decrease of $13,636 (in thousands).\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"-13636\";]."

The context mentions \"deferred subscription revenue,\" which indicates that there may be payments received from clients that have not yet been recognized as revenue.\n\n### Step 2: Translate Table Data and Hints\nFrom the table, we see the following data for 2013 and 2012:\n\n- Deferred subscription revenue for 2013: $26.6 million\n- Deferred subscription revenue for 2012: $24.8 million\n\nThis suggests that the difference in deferred revenue could indicate the payments received from clients that have not yet been recognized as actual revenue.\n\n### Step 3: Define Atomic Operations\nTo find the difference between the payments for revenue from clients and the actual revenue recorded, we can perform the following operations:\n\n1. Identify the deferred revenue for 2013: $26.6 million\n2. Identify the deferred revenue for 2012: $24.8 million\n3. Calculate the difference in deferred revenue: \n   - Difference = Deferred Revenue (2013) - Deferred Revenue (2012)\n   - Difference = $26.6 million - $24.8 million\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Calculation\nNow, let's perform the calculation:\n\n- Difference = $26.6 million - $24.8 million\n- Difference = $1.8 million\n\n### Conclusion\nThe difference between the payments for revenue from clients and the actual revenue recorded is $1.8 million. This indicates that there was an increase in deferred revenue, suggesting that more payments were received from clients than the revenue recognized in the current period.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"1.8 million\"]."

During the year, there were gross increases of $14,009 from prior year tax positions and $11,350 from current year tax positions. However, there were also reductions due to settlements with taxing authorities (-$81,213), lapse of statute of limitations (-$3,512), and foreign exchange losses (-$2,893). The ending balance as of November 28, 2008, was $139,549.\n\n### Step 3: Define Atomic Operations\nTo find the net change in the gross liability, we can calculate it as follows:\n\n1. **Calculate total increases**:\n   - Total increases = Gross increases from prior year + Gross increases from current year\n   - Total increases = $14,009 + $11,350\n\n2. **Calculate total reductions**:\n   - Total reductions = Settlements + Lapse of statute + Foreign exchange losses\n   - Total reductions = -$81,213 - $3,512 - $2,893\n\n3. **Calculate net change**:\n   - Net change = Total increases - Total reductions\n   - Net change = (Total increases) - (Total reductions)\n\n### Step 4: Perform Calculations\n1. **Total increases**:\n   - Total increases = $14,009 + $11,350 = $25,359\n\n2. **Total reductions**:\n   - Total reductions = -$81,213 - $3,512 - $2,893 = -$87,618\n\n3. **Net change**:\n   - Net change = $25,359 - (-$87,618)\n   - Net change = $25,359 + $87,618 = $112,977\n\n### Conclusion\nThe net change in the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2008 is an increase of $112,977.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"$112,977\"]."

We also need to know the number of warrants exercised in 2011, which is not directly provided but can be inferred from the total warrants and those that have expired or were exercised in previous years.\n\n2. **Translation of Table Data**: \n   - As of December 28, 2008, there were several warrants with different exercise prices and expiration dates.\n   - The total number of warrants assumed was 4,489,686.\n   - By the end of 2008, 401,362 warrants were exercised, and 252,164 had expired.\n   - The remaining warrants as of December 28, 2008, can be calculated as follows:\n     - Remaining warrants = Total warrants - Exercised warrants - Expired warrants\n     - Remaining warrants = 4,489,686 - 401,362 - 252,164 = 3,836,160.\n\n3. **Atomic Operations**:\n   - We need to find out how many warrants were exercised in 2011.

We will use this number to extrapolate the total for the entire year if all quarters had the same number of shares purchased.\n\n### Step 2: Translate Table Data and Identify Gold Evidence\nFrom the table, we see that the total number of shares purchased in the fourth quarter (October, November, December) is 3,063,816 shares. \n\n### Step 3: Define a Sequence of Atomic Operations\n1. Identify the total shares purchased in the fourth quarter: \n   - Total shares purchased in Q4 = 3,063,816 shares.\n   \n2. Since we want to find out how many shares would have been purchased if all four quarters had the same number of shares, we will divide the total shares purchased in Q4 by 3 to find the average shares purchased per quarter:\n   - Average shares per quarter = Total shares in Q4 / 3 = 3,063,816 / 3.\n\n3. Multiply the average shares per quarter by 4 to find the total shares for the year:\n   - Total shares for the year = Average shares per quarter * 4.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Calculations\n1. Calculate the average shares per quarter:\n   - Average shares per quarter = 3,063,816 / 3 = 1,021,272 shares.\n\n2. Calculate the total shares for the year:\n   - Total shares for the year = 1,021,272 * 4 = 4,085,088 shares.\n\n### Conclusion\nIf all four quarters of 2010 had the same number of total shares purchased, the total number of shares purchased in 2010 would be 4,085,088 shares.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"4,085,088\"]."
