        "question": "what are the pre-tax earnings in 2016 , in billions?",
        "socratic_answer": "To determine the pre-tax earnings for Goldman Sachs in 2016, we will follow a step-by-step approach based on the provided context.\n\n1. **Relevant Domain Fact**: The context provides information about the pre-tax earnings for 2017 and 2018, but does not directly state the pre-tax earnings for 2016. However, it mentions that net revenues in investment management were $6.22 billion for 2017, which was 7% higher than in 2016. This implies we can calculate the 2016 earnings using the 2017 earnings.\n\n2. **Translation of Table Data and Hints**: \n   - Pre-tax earnings for 2017: $1.42 billion.\n   - Pre-tax earnings for 2018: $1.76 billion.\n   - Net revenues for 2017: $6.22 billion, which is 7% higher than 2016.\n\n3. **Atomic Operations**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the net revenues for 2016.\n   - We know that \\( 6.22 = x \\times (1 + 0.07) \\).\n   - Rearranging gives us \\( x = \\frac{6.22}{1.07} \\).\n   - Calculate \\( x \\):\n     - \\( x = \\frac{6.22}{1.07} \\approx 5.80 \\) billion (net revenues for 2016).\n   - Now, we need to find the pre-tax earnings for 2016. The context does not provide a direct percentage increase or decrease for pre-tax earnings from 2016 to 2017, but we can assume a similar growth pattern as net revenues.\n   - Since pre-tax earnings for 2017 were $1.42 billion, we can estimate the pre-tax earnings for 2016 using the same 7% increase:\n     - Let \\( y \\) be the pre-tax earnings for 2016.\n     - We know \\( 1.42 = y \\times (1 + 0.07) \\).\n     - Rearranging gives us \\( y = \\frac{1.42}{1.07} \\).\n   - Calculate \\( y \\):\n     - \\( y = \\frac{1.42}{1.07} \\approx 1.32 \\) billion.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The pre-tax earnings for Goldman Sachs in 2016 can be estimated as approximately $1.32 billion.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"1.32 billion\"].",

        "cot_zeroshot_answer": "Domain Knowledge: Pre-tax earnings refer to the income a company earns before taxes are deducted. To find the pre-tax earnings for 2016, we need to analyze the information provided in the context, particularly focusing on the year-over-year changes in pre-tax earnings.\n\nGold Evidences:\n- The pre-tax earnings for 2017 were $1.42 billion.\n- The pre-tax earnings for 2018 were $1.76 billion.\n- The increase in pre-tax earnings from 2016 to 2017 was 25%.\n\nSteps:\n1. Let the pre-tax earnings for 2016 be represented as \\( x \\).\n2. According to the information, the pre-tax earnings for 2017 are 25% higher than those for 2016. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   1.25x = 1.42 \\text{ billion}\n   \\]\n3. To find \\( x \\), divide both sides by 1.25:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1.42}{1.25}\n   \\]\n4.

According to the information, we have:\n\\[ x + 0.25x = 1.42 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 1.25x = 1.42 \\]\n\n- Now, we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{1.42}{1.25} \\]\n\n- Calculating the equation:\n\\[ x = 1.136 \\]\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"1.136 (billion)\";]."

        "question": "for natural gas options in place to manage the price risk , what is the change in the percentage of the anticipated natural gas purchases hedged between the first quarter of 2004 and the second quarter of 2004?",
        "socratic_answer": "1. **Relevant Domain Fact**: The question pertains to the percentage of anticipated natural gas purchases that are hedged using options. The context provides specific percentages for the first and second quarters of 2004, which are crucial for calculating the change.\n\n2. **Translation of Table Data and Hints**: \n   - In the first quarter of 2004, 60% of anticipated natural gas purchases are hedged.\n   - In the second quarter of 2004, 50% of anticipated natural gas purchases are hedged.\n   - The question asks for the change in percentage between these two quarters.\n\n3. **Sequence of Atomic Operations**:\n   - Identify the percentage hedged in Q1 2004: 60%\n   - Identify the percentage hedged in Q2 2004: 50%\n   - Calculate the change in percentage: \n     - Change = Percentage in Q1 - Percentage in Q2\n     - Change = 60% - 50%\n     - Change = 10%\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The change in the percentage of anticipated natural gas purchases hedged between the first quarter of 2004 and the second quarter of 2004 is a decrease of 10%. \n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"10% decrease\"].",

        "cot_zeroshot_answer": "Domain Knowledge: To determine the change in the percentage of anticipated natural gas purchases hedged between the first quarter of 2004 and the second quarter of 2004, we need to identify the percentages hedged in each quarter and then calculate the difference between them.\n\nGold Evidences:\n- The percentage of anticipated natural gas purchases hedged in the first quarter of 2004 is 60%.\n- The percentage of anticipated natural gas purchases hedged in the second quarter of 2004 is 50%.\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify the percentage hedged in the first quarter of 2004: \n   - Q1 2004: 60%\n   \n2. Identify the percentage hedged in the second quarter of 2004: \n   - Q2 2004: 50%\n   \n3. Subtract the percentage hedged in Q2 from the percentage hedged in Q1:\n   - Change = Q1 - Q2 = 60% - 50% = 10%\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"10%\";].",
        "cot_fewshot_answer": "- From the context, it is stated that natural gas options are in place to manage the price risk associated with approximately 60% of the anticipated natural gas purchases for refinery use through the first quarter of 2004 and 50% through the second quarter of 2004.\n\n- To find the change in the percentage of the anticipated natural gas purchases hedged, we can set up the equation as follows:\n  \n  Change in percentage = Percentage in Q1 2004 - Percentage in Q2 2004\n  Change in percentage = 60% - 50%\n\n- Now, we calculate the equation:\n  Change in percentage = 60 - 50 = 10\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"10%\";]."
