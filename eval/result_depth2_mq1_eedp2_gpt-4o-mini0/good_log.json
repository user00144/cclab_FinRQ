The total cost of redemption includes the principal, accrued interest, and prepayment penalty:\n   - Total Cost = Principal + Accrued Interest + Prepayment Penalty\n   - Total Cost = $250.0 million + $19.6875 million + $1.4 million = $271.0875 million\n\n3.

The total cost of redemption was $258.6, which included the principal amount, accrued interest, and a prepayment penalty of $1.4.\n\n- To find the total interest expense incurred, we need to calculate the interest for the period leading up to the redemption. The total cost of redemption ($258.6) minus the principal amount ($250.0) gives us the total interest and penalties incurred.\n\n- Make Equation: \n  Total Interest Expense = Total Cost of Redemption - Principal Amount\n  Total Interest Expense = $258.6 - $250.0\n\n- Calculate Equation: \n  Total Interest Expense = $258.6 - $250.0 = $8.6\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"8.6 (million)\";]."
