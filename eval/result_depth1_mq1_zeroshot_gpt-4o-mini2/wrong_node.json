This indicates that the increase in operating expenses due to fuel prices was $242 million.\n\n2. **Calculating Total Operating Expenses**: However, the context does not provide the total operating expenses for 2006 directly. We can infer that if the increase of $242 million represents a 9% increase, we can set up the following equation to find the total operating expenses for 2006 (let's denote it as X):\n   \\[\n   0.09X = 242 \\text{ million}\n   \\]\n   Solving for X gives:\n   \\[\n   X = \\frac{242}{0.09} \\approx 2688.89 \\text{ million}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total operating expenses for 2006 were approximately $2688.89 million.\n\n3. **Total Operating Expenses for 2007**: To find the total operating expenses for 2007, we add the increase to the 2006 total:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Operating Expenses in 2007} = 2688.89 + 242 \\approx 2930.89 \\text{ million}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Relation to the 9% Increase**: The 9% increase in operating expenses is directly related to the increase in fuel prices, which added $242 million to the previous year's expenses.\n\nIn summary, the total operating expenses in 2007 were approximately $2930.89 million, reflecting a 9% increase from the previous year due to rising fuel costs.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"Approximately $2930.89 million in total operating expenses for 2007, reflecting a 9% increase compared to 2006\"; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."

The context mentions that the company exchanged all of its $250.0 million floating rate notes due 2008 for $250.0 million aggregate principal amount floating rate notes due 2010. This indicates that the issuance of the new floating rate notes did not increase the total long-term debt but rather replaced the old notes.\n3. Therefore, the original amount of long-term debt before the issuance of the floating rate notes maturing in 2010 would still be the total long-term debt minus the amount of the old floating rate notes that were exchanged.\n\nSince the old floating rate notes were $250.0 million, we can calculate:\n\nOriginal long-term debt = Total long-term debt - Old floating rate notes\nOriginal long-term debt = $2,251.2 million - $250.0 million\nOriginal long-term debt = $2,001.2 million\n\nThus, the original amount of long-term debt before the issuance of the floating rate notes maturing in 2010 is $2,001.2 million.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"$2001.2 million\"; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."

It is stated that approximately 57,100 square feet of this space is occupied by the lease administration office and the broadcast division. Therefore, to find the square footage that is leased to unaffiliated tenants, we need to subtract the space occupied by the lease administration office and the broadcast division from the total square footage.\n\nCalculating this gives us:\nTotal square footage = 163,000 square feet\nSpace occupied by lease administration and broadcast division = 57,100 square feet\n\nSpace leased to unaffiliated tenants = Total square footage - Space occupied\n= 163,000 - 57,100\n= 105,900 square feet\n\nThus, the total square footage of the Woburn property that is leased to unaffiliated tenants is 105,900 square feet.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"105900\"; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."
