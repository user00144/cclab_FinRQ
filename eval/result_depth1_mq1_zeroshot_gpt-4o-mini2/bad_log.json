        "question": "what was the percentage decrease in cash flows from operations from 2009 to 2010?",
        "socratic_answer": "To calculate the percentage decrease in cash flows from operations from 2009 to 2010, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cash flows from operations for both years:\n   - Cash flows from operations in 2009: $559.7 million\n   - Cash flows from operations in 2010 (after adjusting for the $250 million impact): $765.2 million\n\n2. Calculate the change in cash flows from operations:\n   - Change = Cash flows in 2010 - Cash flows in 2009\n   - Change = $765.2 million - $559.7 million = $205.5 million\n\n3. Since we are looking for the percentage decrease, we need to note that there was actually an increase in cash flows from 2009 to 2010. Therefore, the percentage decrease is not applicable in this case.\n\n4. To find the percentage increase instead, we can use the formula:\n   - Percentage Increase = (Change / Cash flows in 2009) * 100\n   - Percentage Increase = ($205.5 million / $559.7 million) * 100 ≈ 36.7%\n\nSince the question specifically asks for the percentage decrease, and there was no decrease but rather an increase, we can conclude that the percentage decrease is effectively 0%.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"0%\";].",

        "cot_zeroshot_answer": "To find the percentage decrease in cash flows from operations from 2009 to 2010, we need to extract the cash flow values for those years from the provided context.\n\n1. **Extract important evidence:**\n   - Cash flows from operations in 2009: $559.7 million\n   - Cash flows from operations in 2010: $515.2 million\n\n2. **Make an executable equation:**\n   The formula for percentage decrease is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Decrease} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Old Value} - \\text{New Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   Here, the old value is the cash flow from operations in 2009 ($559.7 million) and the new value is the cash flow from operations in 2010 ($515.2 million).\n\n3. **Calculate the equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Decrease} = \\left( \\frac{559.7 - 515.2}{559.7} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\left( \\frac{44.5}{559.7} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\approx 7.95\\%\n   \\]\n\nThus, the percentage decrease in cash flows from operations from 2009 to 2010 is approximately 7.95%.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"7.95%\"].",
        "cot_fewshot_answer": "- From the context, the cash flows provided by operating activities in 2009 were $559.7 million and in 2010 were $515.2 million.\n\n- To find the percentage decrease, we first calculate the decrease in cash flows from 2009 to 2010:\n  Decrease = Cash flows in 2009 - Cash flows in 2010\n  Decrease = 559.7 - 515.2 = 44.5 million.\n\n- Next, we calculate the percentage decrease using the formula:\n  Percentage Decrease = (Decrease / Cash flows in 2009) * 100\n  Percentage Decrease = (44.5 / 559.7) * 100.\n\n- Now, we calculate the equation:\n  Percentage Decrease = (44.5 / 559.7) * 100 ≈ 7.95%.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"7.95%\";]."
