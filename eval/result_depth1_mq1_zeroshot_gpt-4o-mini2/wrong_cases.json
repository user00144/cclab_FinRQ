Calculate the decrease in the interest rate:\n   - Decrease = Interest Rate in 2010 - Interest Rate in 2011\n   - Decrease = 5.3% - 3.5% = 1.8%\n\n3. Calculate the percentage decrease:\n   - Percentage Decrease = (Decrease / Interest Rate in 2010) * 100\n   - Percentage Decrease = (1.8% / 5.3%) * 100\n\n4.
