The difference between the beginning and ending accounts receivable can help determine the net change in payments received relative to sales.\n\nGold Evidences:\n- Trade and other accounts receivable in 2013: $546.5 million\n- Trade and other accounts receivable in 2012: $516.9 million\n- Allowances for doubtful accounts in 2013: -$14.9 million\n- Allowances for doubtful accounts in 2012: -$19.0 million\n- Total trade and other accounts receivable net in 2013: $531.6 million\n- Total trade and other accounts receivable net in 2012: $497.9 million\n\nSteps:\n1. Subtract the net accounts receivable for 2012 from the net accounts receivable for 2013.\n   - Response 1: $531.6 million - $497.9 million = $33.7 million\n\nExplanation: The net accounts receivable increased by $33.7 million from 2012 to 2013. This increase suggests that the total payments received during 2013 were $33.7 million less than the total sales made on credit. Therefore, the difference between total sales and total payments received during 2013 is $33.7 million.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"$33.7 million\";].",
