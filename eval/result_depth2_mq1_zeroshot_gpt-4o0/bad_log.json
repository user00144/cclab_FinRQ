        "cot_fewshot_answer": "- From the context, on August 21, 2018, the board of directors approved an increase to the current authorization for the stock repurchase program by an additional $2.0 billion to $8.2 billion in the aggregate.\n\n- To find the percentage increase, we need to determine the original authorization amount before the increase. The increase was $2.0 billion, and the new total authorization is $8.2 billion. Therefore, the original authorization was $8.2 billion - $2.0 billion = $6.2 billion.\n\n- Make Equation: (Increase / Original Authorization) * 100 = Percentage Increase\n\n- Calculate Equation: ($2.0 billion / $6.2 billion) * 100 = 32.26%\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"32.26%\";]."
