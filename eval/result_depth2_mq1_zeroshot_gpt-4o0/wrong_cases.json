The hint might be misleading, as it suggests the net interest income is equal to the total interest earned, which is not typically the case.\n\nGiven the context, the net interest income on a managed basis is already provided as $51,410 million, which means the total interest earned on assets should be higher than this amount, and the difference would be the interest expenses.\n\nSince the hint and the context seem to provide conflicting information, let's assume the net interest income is the result after deducting expenses from a higher total interest earned. Therefore, the expenses associated with liabilities would be the difference between the total interest earned (which should be higher than $51,410 million) and the net interest income.\n\nHowever, without additional information on the actual total interest earned, we cannot accurately calculate the expenses. The hint seems to be incorrect or incomplete.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the expenses associated with liabilities cannot be determined accurately.
