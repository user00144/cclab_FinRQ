Therefore, we cannot calculate a percentage decrease because the cash flows increased.\n\nTo express this in percentage terms, we can calculate the percentage increase instead:\n\nPercentage Increase = (Change / Cash flows in 2009) * 100\nPercentage Increase = ($205.5 million / $559.7 million) * 100\nPercentage Increase ≈ 36.7%\n\nSince the question asks for a percentage decrease, and there was none, we can conclude that the cash flows from operations actually increased.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"0%\";].",

        "socratic_answer": "To find the ratio of the total property and equipment net in 2006 to that in 2005, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total property and equipment net for both years from the provided data:\n   - For 2006, the total property and equipment net is $61,535.\n   - For 2005, the total property and equipment net is $54,533.\n\n2. Calculate the ratio by dividing the total property and equipment net for 2006 by that for 2005:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Property and Equipment Net (2006)}}{\\text{Total Property and Equipment Net (2005)}} = \\frac{61,535}{54,533}\n   \\]\n\n3. Performing the calculation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} \\approx 1.128\n   \\]\n\n4. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage} \\approx 1.128 \\times 100 \\approx 112.8\\%\n   \\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the total property and equipment net in 2006 to that in 2005 is approximately 112.8%.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"112.8%\";].",
