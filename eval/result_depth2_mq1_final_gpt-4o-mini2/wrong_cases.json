Since $1 million is equal to $1,000 thousand, we can express $151.7 million as $151,700 thousand.\n3. Now, we divide the total purchase price by the number of sites:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price per site} = \\frac{\\text{Total Purchase Price}}{\\text{Number of Sites}} = \\frac{151700}{800}\n   \\]\n4. Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price per site} = 189.625\n   \\]\n\nThus, the approximate price for each site the company purchased on March 30, 2012, is $189.625 thousand.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"189.625\";]."

However, we can infer that the statutory capital and surplus for Bermuda subsidiaries in 2008 was $7,001 million.

We know that revenue-ton-miles increased by 9% in 2010 compared to 2009. If we assume \\( R_{2009} \\) is the revenue-ton-miles for 2009, we can express \\( R_{2010} \\) as:\n   \\[\n   R_{2010} = R_{2009} \\times 1.09\n   \\]\n   And for 2011:\n   \\[\n   R_{2011} = R_{2010} \\times 1.05\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the revenue-ton-miles for 2009**: We do not have the exact figure for \\( R_{2009} \\) either, but we can assume it is a certain value \\( X \\). Thus:\n   \\[\n   R_{2010} = X \\times 1.09\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   R_{2011} = (X \\times 1.09) \\times 1.05 = X \\times 1.1445\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate \\( R_{without} \\)**: Now substituting back into our equation for \\( R_{without} \\):\n   \\[\n   R_{without} = 0.40 \\times (X \\times 1.1445) = 0.4578X\n   \\]\n\nSince we do not have the exact value of \\( X \\) (the revenue-ton-miles for 2009), we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, we can conclude that the revenue-ton-miles without the increase in carloads and mix changes would be 40% of the total revenue-ton-miles in 2011.\n\nThus, the final answer is [Answer: \"40% of R_{2011}\";]."
