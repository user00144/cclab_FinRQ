However, it also mentions that this amount did not include preliminary closing adjustments totaling $18.5 million.\n\nTo find the gross proceeds before these adjustments, we need to add the preliminary closing adjustments to the gross proceeds amount:\n\n1. Gross proceeds from the sale: $280 million\n2. Preliminary closing adjustments: $18.5 million\n\nNow, we add these two amounts together:\n\nGross proceeds = $280 million + $18.5 million = $298.5 million\n\nThus, the gross proceeds from the sale of the packaging business, if the preliminary closing adjustments are not finalized, is $298.5 million.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"298.5 millions\";].",
