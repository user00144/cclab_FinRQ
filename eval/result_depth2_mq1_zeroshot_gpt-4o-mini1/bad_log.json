        "question": "what was the percentage decrease in cash flows from operations from 2009 to 2010?",
        "socratic_answer": "To calculate the percentage decrease in cash flows from operations from 2009 to 2010, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cash flows from operations for both years:\n   - Cash flows from operations in 2009: $559.7 million\n   - Cash flows from operations in 2010 (excluding the $250 million impact): $765.2 million\n\n2. Calculate the decrease in cash flows from operations:\n   - Since the cash flow in 2010 is higher than in 2009, we actually have an increase, not a decrease. Therefore, we will calculate the percentage increase instead.\n\n3. Calculate the percentage increase:\n   - The formula for percentage increase is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{765.2 - 559.7}{559.7} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{205.5}{559.7} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 36.7\\%\n     \\]\n\nSince the question specifically asks for the percentage decrease, and there was no decrease but an increase, we can conclude that the percentage decrease is effectively 0%.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"0%\";].",

        "socratic_answer": "To determine the ratio of the increase in cash in 2009 due to the issuance of debt compared to the reduction of debt instruments, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the increase in cash due to debt issuance in 2009**: \n   - The text states that there were new issuances of debt of $2.9 billion in 2008. However, it does not specify the amount of debt issued in 2009. Therefore, we will assume that the increase in cash due to debt issuance in 2009 is $0, as the focus is on the reduction of debt instruments.\n\n2. **Identify the reduction of debt instruments in 2009**: \n   - The text mentions net debt reductions of $900.1 million in debt instruments.\n\n3. **Calculate the ratio**: \n   - Since the increase in cash due to debt issuance in 2009 is assumed to be $0, the ratio of the increase in cash due to debt issuance to the reduction of debt instruments would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Increase in cash due to debt issuance}}{\\text{Reduction of debt instruments}} = \\frac{0}{900.1} = 0\n   \\]\n\nThus, the ratio is 0, indicating that there was no increase in cash from debt issuance in 2009 compared to the reduction of debt instruments.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"0\";].",

        "socratic_answer": "To find the ratio of the cumulative return for Intel to the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Index in 2010, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the cumulative returns for both Intel and the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Index in 2010 from the provided table**:\n   - For Intel Corporation in 2010: $157\n   - For Dow Jones U.S. Technology Index in 2010: $191\n\n2. **Calculate the ratio**:\n   - The ratio is calculated by dividing the cumulative return of Intel by the cumulative return of the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Index.\n   - Ratio = Intel Return / Dow Jones Return = $157 / $191\n\n3. **Perform the calculation**:\n   - Ratio = 157 / 191 ≈ 0.8225\n\n4. **Convert the ratio to a percentage for clarity**:\n   - Percentage = 0.8225 * 100 ≈ 82.25%\n\nThus, the ratio of the cumulative return for Intel to the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Index in 2010 is approximately 82.25%.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"82.25%\";].",
