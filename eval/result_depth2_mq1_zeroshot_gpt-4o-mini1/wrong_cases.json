This means that if there are allowances for doubtful accounts, the recognized revenue may be higher than the cash actually received.\n\n2. **Assessing Allowances for Doubtful Accounts**: The context mentions that Snap-on performs detailed reviews of its receivables to assess the adequacy of allowances based on historical trends and other factors. This implies that some receivables may not be collected, leading to a difference between recognized revenue and cash received.\n\n3. **Charge-offs**: The context also states that amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances. This means that if a receivable is deemed uncollectible, it will reduce the allowances and thus affect the net revenue recognized.\n\n4. **Calculating the Difference**: The total other accrued liabilities for 2013 is $243.7 million, and for 2012 it was $247.9 million. The difference in accrued liabilities from 2012 to 2013 is $4.2 million. This could indicate a change in the allowances for doubtful accounts or other accrued liabilities that may affect the revenue recognized.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: Since the question asks for the difference between payments for revenue from clients and the actual revenue recorded, we can infer that the difference is likely related to the changes in allowances for doubtful accounts and charge-offs. Given the context and the accrued liabilities, we can estimate that the difference is approximately equal to the change in allowances.\n\nThus, the difference between the payments for revenue from clients and the actual revenue recorded is approximately $4.2 million.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"4.2 millions\";]."
