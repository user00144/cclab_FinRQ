However, it mentions that net revenues in investment management were $6.22 billion for 2017, which was 7% higher than in 2016. This implies we can calculate the 2016 earnings using the 2017 figure.\n\n2. **Translation of Table Data and Hints**: \n   - Pre-tax earnings for 2017: $1.42 billion.\n   - Net revenues for 2017: $6.22 billion.\n   - The increase from 2016 to 2017 was 7%.\n\n3. **Atomic Operations**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the net revenues for 2016.\n   - According to the information, \\( x \\times 1.07 = 6.22 \\) billion (since 2017 revenues are 7% higher than 2016).\n   - To find \\( x \\), we can rearrange the equation: \n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{6.22}{1.07}\n     \\]\n   - Now, we will perform the division:\n     \\[\n     x \\approx 5.80 \\text{ billion}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - We have calculated the net revenues for 2016 to be approximately $5.80 billion.
