This indicates that we can calculate the operating expenses for 2006 and then determine the total operating expenses for 2007.\n\n### Step 2: Translate Table Data and Hints\nFrom the context, we know:\n- The increase in operating expenses due to fuel prices in 2007 was $242 million.\n- This increase represents a 9% rise in operating expenses compared to 2006.\n\n### Step 3: Define Atomic Operations\n1. Let \\( E_{2006} \\) be the operating expenses in 2006.\n2. The increase in operating expenses in 2007 can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   0.09 \\times E_{2006} = 242 \\text{ million}\n   \\]\n3.

Calculate \\( E_{2007} \\):\n   \\[\n   E_{2007} = 2689 + 242 = 2931 \\text{ million}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe total operating expenses in 2007 were approximately $2931 million. The 9% increase in operating expenses from 2006 to 2007 corresponds to an increase of $242 million, which confirms our calculations.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"Total operating expenses in 2007 were approximately $2931 million.\"];"

The relevant information includes the number of stock options and their average exercise prices for both years.\n\n### Step 2: Translate Table Data and Hints\nFrom the table:\n- For 2016:\n  - Stock options: 13 million\n  - Average exercise price: $26.93\n- For 2017:\n  - Stock options: 11 million\n  - Average exercise price: $33.32\n\n### Step 3: Define Atomic Operations\nWe will calculate the total value of stock options for each year and then find the difference.\n\n1. **Calculate total value for 2016:**\n   - Total value (2016) = Number of stock options (2016) * Average exercise price (2016)\n   - Total value (2016) = 13 million * $26.93\n\n2. **Calculate total value for 2017:**\n   - Total value (2017) = Number of stock options (2017) * Average exercise price (2017)\n   - Total value (2017) = 11 million * $33.32\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Difference = Total value (2017) - Total value (2016)\n\n### Step 4: Perform Calculations\n1. **Total value for 2016:**\n   - Total value (2016) = 13,000,000 * 26.93 = $349,090,000\n\n2. **Total value for 2017:**\n   - Total value (2017) = 11,000,000 * 33.32 = $366,520,000\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Difference = $366,520,000 - $349,090,000 = $17,430,000\n\n### Conclusion\nThe difference in the total value of stock options calculated using the average exercise price and the number of stock options for 2016 and 2017 is $17,430,000.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"$17,430,000\";]."

However, it does not provide direct figures for 2009. We need to analyze the trends in the provided data to estimate the 2009 figures.\n\n2. **Translation of Table Data**: \n   - Statutory capital and surplus for Bermuda subsidiaries:\n     - 2008: $7,001 million\n     - 2007: $8,579 million\n     - 2006: $7,605 million\n   - Statutory net income for Bermuda subsidiaries:\n     - 2008: $684 million\n     - 2007: $1,535 million\n     - 2006: $1,527 million\n\n   The gold evidence here is that we have the figures for the previous years, which we can use to identify trends.\n\n3. **Sequence of Atomic Operations**:\n   - **Statutory Capital and Surplus**:\n     - From 2006 to 2007: $8,579 million - $7,605 million = $974 million increase\n     - From 2007 to 2008: $7,001 million - $8,579 million = -$1,578 million decrease\n     - The trend shows a significant decrease from 2007 to 2008. If we assume a similar trend continues, we might expect a further decrease in 2009.\n   - **Statutory Net Income**:\n     - From 2006 to 2007: $1,535 million - $1,527 million = $8 million increase\n     - From 2007 to 2008: $684 million - $1,535 million = -$851 million decrease\n     - The trend also shows a significant decrease from 2007 to 2008. If this trend continues, we might expect a further decrease in 2009.\n\n4. **Estimation for 2009**:\n   - For statutory capital and surplus, if we assume a similar decrease as from 2007 to 2008, we can estimate:\n     - 2009 = 2008 - (2007 - 2008) = $7,001 million - $1,578 million = $5,423 million (estimated).\n   - For statutory net income, if we assume a similar decrease as from 2007 to 2008:\n     - 2009 = 2008 - (2007 - 2008) = $684 million - $851 million = -$167 million (estimated, indicating a loss).\n\nIn conclusion, while we do not have exact figures for 2009, based on the trends observed in the previous years, we estimate:\n- Statutory capital and surplus for Bermuda subsidiaries in 2009: approximately $5,423 million.\n- Statutory net income for Bermuda subsidiaries in 2009: approximately -$167 million (indicating a loss).\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"Statutory capital and surplus: $5,423 million; Statutory net income: -$167 million\"]."

Deductions for investments in nonconsolidated financial institutions: -9091\n6. Other adjustments: -489\n\n### Step 2: Translate Table Data into Sentences\nThe common shareholders' equity is adjusted by various deductions and adjustments to arrive at the Basel III CET1. The total deductions include goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, and other adjustments, while deferred tax liabilities are added back.\n\n### Step 3: Define Atomic Operations\nWe will perform the following calculations step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate total deductions:**\n   - Goodwill: -3705\n   - Identifiable intangible assets: -671\n   - Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets net of deferred tax liabilities: -3468 (this is already included in the previous two)\n   - Deductions for investments in nonconsolidated financial institutions: -9091\n   - Other adjustments: -489\n\n2. **Sum the deductions:**\n   - Total deductions = Goodwill + Identifiable intangible assets + Deductions for investments + Other adjustments\n   - Total deductions = -3705 + (-671) + (-9091) + (-489)\n\n3. **Calculate the total:**\n   - Total deductions = -3705 - 671 - 9091 - 489\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Calculations\nNow, let's perform the calculations:\n\n1. **Sum the deductions:**\n   - Total deductions = -3705 - 671 - 9091 - 489\n   - Total deductions = -3705 - 671 = -4376\n   - Total deductions = -4376 - 9091 = -13467\n   - Total deductions = -13467 - 489 = -13956\n\n### Conclusion\nThe total amount of deductions and adjustments applied to the common shareholders' equity to arrive at the Basel III CET1 is -13956 million dollars.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"-13956 million dollars\";]."

The effective tax rate is influenced by various factors, including tax benefits and deductions, while the statutory tax rate is the fixed rate set by law.\n\n### Step 2: Translate Table Data and Hints\nFrom the provided table, we can extract the following information for 2017:\n- Statutory U.S. federal tax rate: 35.0%\n- Effective tax expense (benefit) rate: (60.8)%\n\nThe hint indicates that we need to calculate the gross amount of the recognized tax benefit based on the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate.\n\n### Step 3: Define Atomic Operations\n1. Identify the difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate:\n   - Statutory tax rate = 35.0%\n   - Effective tax rate = (60.8)%\n   - Difference = Statutory tax rate - Effective tax rate\n\n2. Calculate the gross amount of the recognized tax benefit:\n   - Recognized tax benefit = $2.6 billion\n   - To find the gross amount, we can use the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gross amount} = \\text{Recognized tax benefit} / \\left(1 - \\text{Effective tax rate}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Perform Calculations\n1. Calculate the difference:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 35.0\\% - (-60.8\\%) = 35.0\\% + 60.8\\% = 95.8\\%\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the gross amount of the recognized tax benefit:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross amount} = \\frac{2.6 \\text{ billion}}{1 - (-0.608)} = \\frac{2.6 \\text{ billion}}{1 + 0.608} = \\frac{2.6 \\text{ billion}}{1.608} \\approx 1.617 \\text{ billion}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, was (60.8)%, which is significantly lower than the statutory tax rate of 35.0%. The gross amount of the recognized tax benefit, calculated based on the effective tax rate, is approximately $1.617 billion.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"$1.617 billion\";]."
