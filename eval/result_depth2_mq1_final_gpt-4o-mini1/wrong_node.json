However, the context does not specify which specific warrants were exercised or their corresponding exercise prices.\n\nLooking at the summary of warrants outstanding as of December 28, 2008, we see the following exercise prices:\n\n- 238,510 warrants at $7.27\n- 864,040 warrants at $7.27\n- 809,246 warrants at $10.91\n- 1,125,734 warrants at $10.91\n- 18,322,320 warrants at $31.44\n- 21,359,850 warrants with no specified exercise price\n\nSince the total cash proceeds from the exercised warrants were $3.0 million, we can calculate the average exercise price if we assume that the warrants exercised were from the lower exercise price categories, as they would be more likely to be exercised.\n\nIf we consider the two lower exercise prices of $7.27 and $10.91, we can estimate that the warrants exercised were likely from the $7.27 category, as they would yield a higher number of exercised warrants for the total cash proceeds.\n\nHowever, without specific information on which warrants were exercised, we cannot definitively state the exercise price of the warrants that were exercised in 2008.\n\nThus, the final answer is: The exercise price of the warrants that were exercised in 2008 is uncertain based on the provided context.

This includes $20 billion from the Verus acquisition and $5 billion in equity asset outflows, which means the net inflows are indeed $42 billion.\n\n2. **Liquidity Products**: The context mentions that liquidity products decreased by $13 billion in 2017, which indicates that there were net outflows in this category. However, it also states that there were $3 billion of inflows in connection with the Verus acquisition. Therefore, the net outflows for liquidity products would be $13 billion (decrease) - $3 billion (inflows) = $10 billion (net outflows).\n\n3. **Total Net Inflows Calculation**: \n   - Long-term AUS net inflows: $42 billion\n   - Liquidity products net inflows: -$10 billion (indicating outflows)\n   - Total net inflows = $42 billion (long-term AUS) - $10 billion (liquidity products) = $32 billion.\n\nThus, the total net inflows for long-term AUS and liquidity products in 2017 is $32 billion.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"$32 billion\"; Used hints: \"1\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."

While the exact formula is not explicitly stated in the context, it can generally be represented as:\n\n**Expected Return = (Historical Rate of Return) * (Proportion of Each Investment Type)**\n\nThis formula indicates that the expected return is a weighted average of the historical returns of the different types of investments held in the plan, adjusted for their respective proportions in the overall asset allocation.\n\nThe relationship to the total value of those assets is that the expected return is a projection of how much income the assets will generate over time, which directly impacts the funding status of the pension plan and the financial statements of the company.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\nThe expected return on plan assets is calculated using a formula that considers historical rates of return, the nature of the investments, and investment strategies, typically represented as a weighted average based on the asset allocation.

The long-term debt obligations after accounting for current maturities is $70,842,000.\n\nSince the question asks for the total long-term debt amount as of December 31, 2012, we need to consider the scheduled maturities and the current maturities. The current maturities due in 2012 will reduce the total long-term debt.\n\nThus, the total long-term debt amount as of December 31, 2012, can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal long-term debt as of December 31, 2011: $70,842,000\nLess current maturities due in 2012: $6,882,000\n\nTotal long-term debt as of December 31, 2012 = $70,842,000 - $6,882,000 = $63,960,000.\n\nHowever, since the context does not explicitly state the total long-term debt amount after the current maturities are accounted for, I will rely on the provided figures.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"$70,842,000\"; Used hints: \"(1)\"; Confidence: \"middle\"]."

If we assume this trend continues, we can estimate the operating lease obligations for 2018 by continuing the trend of decreasing obligations.\n\nSince the last recorded amount is $116 million in 2012, we can project the decrease for the subsequent years (2013 to 2018, which is 6 years):\n\n- 2013: $116 million - $65 million = $51 million\n- 2014: $51 million - $65 million = -$14 million (which indicates that the operating lease obligations may reach zero before 2018)\n\nGiven that operating lease obligations cannot be negative, we can reasonably conclude that by 2018, the expected cash outflow for operating leases would be $0 million.\n\nThus, the final answer is [Answer: \"0 million\"; Used hints: \"1\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."

This indicates that revenue can be recognized before the actual cash is received, leading to discrepancies.\n\n2. **Impairment of Receivables**: The context states that a receivable is considered impaired when it is probable that all amounts related to it will not be collected according to the contractual terms. If receivables become impaired, this can affect the cash flow as the expected cash payments may not materialize.\n\n3. **Charge-offs**: The context explains that amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances, which means that if a receivable is charged off, it will not contribute to cash payments, further contributing to discrepancies.\n\n4. **Recovery of Previously Charged-off Accounts**: The context also mentions that amounts recovered on previously charged-off accounts increase the allowances. This indicates that there can be fluctuations in cash flow based on recoveries, which may not align with revenue recognized earlier.\n\nBased on these points, the factors contributing to discrepancies include timing differences in revenue recognition, impairment of receivables, charge-offs, and recoveries of previously charged-off accounts.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"Factors contributing to discrepancies include timing differences in revenue recognition, impairment of receivables, charge-offs, and recoveries of previously charged-off accounts.\"; Used hints: \"1\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."

            "raw_answer": "To determine the total number of berths expected to be in service by the end of 2021, we can use the information provided in the context. \n\nFrom the context, we know:\n- The global cruise fleet had approximately 503,000 berths at the end of 2016.\n- An additional 173,000 berths are expected to be placed in service between 2017 and 2021.\n\nTo find the total number of berths expected by the end of 2021, we add the current number of berths to the expected additional berths:\n\n503,000 (current berths) + 173,000 (additional berths) = 676,000 berths.\n\nNow, we can compare this to the 503,000 berths at the end of 2016. The expected number of berths in 2021 (676,000) is an increase from the 2016 figure (503,000).\n\nThus, the total number of berths expected to be in service by the end of 2021 is 676,000, which represents an increase of 173,000 berths compared to the 503,000 berths at the end of 2016.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"676,000 berths; Used hints: \"(1)\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."
