        "socratic_answer": "To determine the net effect of the adoption of new accounting standards, we need to analyze the cumulative effect adjustments provided in the context.\n\n1. **Identify the cumulative effect adjustments**:\n   - Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606): +$91,640 (net of tax effect)\n   - Financial instruments (Subtopic 825-10): +$2,638\n   - Income taxes (Topic 740): -$8,349 (this is a reduction)\n\n2. **Calculate the total cumulative effect adjustment**:\n   - Total adjustment = Revenue adjustment + Financial instruments adjustment - Income taxes adjustment\n   - Total adjustment = $91,640 + $2,638 - $8,349\n   - Total adjustment = $91,640 + $2,638 - $8,349 = $85,929\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   The total cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings from the adoption of new accounting standards is indeed $85,929, as indicated in the hint.\n\nThus, the net effect of the adoption of new accounting standards is $85,929.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"85929\";].",

        "cot_zeroshot_answer": "Response #:\n\nDomain Knowledge: The net effect of the adoption of new accounting standards refers to the cumulative adjustments made to retained earnings as a result of implementing new accounting standards. This includes both increases and decreases in retained earnings due to the adoption of these standards.\n\nGold Evidences:\n- The balance of retained earnings as previously reported on December 30, 2017, was $341,003,000.\n- The cumulative effect adjustment from the adoption of new accounting standards includes:\n  - Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606): +$91,640,000\n  - Financial instruments (Subtopic 825-10): +$2,638,000\n  - Income taxes (Topic 740): -$8,349,000\n- The balance of retained earnings as adjusted on December 30, 2017, was $426,932,000.\n\nSteps:\n1.
