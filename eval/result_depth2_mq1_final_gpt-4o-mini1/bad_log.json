        "question": "what was the percentage decrease in cash flows from operations from 2009 to 2010?",
        "socratic_answer": "To calculate the percentage decrease in cash flows from operations from 2009 to 2010, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cash flows from operations for both years:\n   - Cash flows from operations in 2009: $559.7 million\n   - Cash flows from operations in 2010 (excluding the $250 million impact): $765.2 million\n\n2. Calculate the decrease in cash flows from operations:\n   - Since the cash flow in 2010 is higher than in 2009, we actually have an increase, not a decrease. Therefore, we will calculate the percentage increase instead.\n\n3. Calculate the percentage increase:\n   - The formula for percentage increase is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{765.2 - 559.7}{559.7} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{205.5}{559.7} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 36.7\\%\n     \\]\n\nSince the question specifically asks for the percentage decrease, and we found an increase, we can conclude that there was no decrease in cash flows from operations from 2009 to 2010.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"0%\";].",

        "socratic_answer": "To find the ratio of the total property and equipment net in 2006 to that in 2005, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total property and equipment net for both years from the provided data:\n   - For 2006: $61,535 (in thousands)\n   - For 2005: $54,533 (in thousands)\n\n2. Calculate the ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Property and Equipment Net in 2006}}{\\text{Total Property and Equipment Net in 2005}} = \\frac{61,535}{54,533}\n   \\]\n\n3.
