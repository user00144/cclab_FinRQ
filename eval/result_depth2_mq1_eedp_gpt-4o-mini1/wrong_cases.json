To find the percentage decrease in the weighted average interest rates from 2010 to 2011, we need to calculate the difference between the two rates, divide that difference by the 2010 rate, and then multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nGold Evidences:\n- The weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2010, was 5.3%.\n- The weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2011, was 3.5%.\n\nSteps:\n1. Subtract the 2011 interest rate from the 2010 interest rate.\n   - Response 1: 5.3% - 3.5% = 1.8%\n2. Divide the difference by the 2010 interest rate.\n   - Response 2: 1.8% / 5.3% = 0.3396\n3. Multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage.\n   - Response 3: 0.3396 Ã— 100 = 33.96%\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"33.96%\";]."
