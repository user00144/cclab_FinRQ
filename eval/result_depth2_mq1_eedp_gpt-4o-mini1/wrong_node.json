To find the fair value at the end of 2008 and 2009, we need to look for historical data or trends in the provided context.\n\nGold Evidences:\n- The context mentions that the company stopped originating commercial mortgage loans held for sale designated at fair value in 2008.\n- The fair value of commercial mortgages at December 31, 2012, was $772 million, and at December 31, 2011, it was $843 million.\n- There is no direct mention of the fair value for the years 2008 and 2009 in the provided context.\n\nSteps:\n1. Since the context does not provide specific values for 2008 and 2009, we can infer that the fair value of commercial mortgage loans held for sale designated at fair value was likely higher in 2008 than in 2011 and 2012, as the company stopped originating these loans in 2008.\n2. The fair value decreased from $843 million in 2011 to $772 million in 2012, indicating a downward trend.\n3. Without specific data for 2008 and 2009, we cannot provide exact figures, but we can conclude that the fair value in 2008 was likely above $843 million, and in 2009, it would have been lower than 2008 but higher than 843 million.\n\nConclusion: The fair value of commercial mortgage loans held for sale designated at fair value at the end of 2008 is not explicitly provided, but it is inferred to be above $843 million. The fair value for 2009 is also not provided but would be lower than 2008 and likely above $843 million.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"The fair value at the end of 2008 is inferred to be above $843 million; the fair value for 2009 is not explicitly provided but is likely above $843 million.\";]."

Identify the amount of floating rate notes that were exchanged:\n   - Amount of floating rate notes exchanged = $250.0 million.\n\n3. Subtract the amount of floating rate notes from the total long-term debt to find the original amount of long-term debt before the issuance of the floating rate notes maturing in 2010:\n   - Original long-term debt = Total long-term debt - Amount of floating rate notes exchanged\n   - Original long-term debt = $2,251.2 million - $250.0 million = $2,001.2 million.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"$2,001.2 million\";]."

Operating profit reflects the profitability of a company's core business operations, while net sales represent the total revenue generated from sales of goods or services. Operating expenses include costs such as salaries, rent, and materials. Understanding the relationship between these three components is crucial for analyzing a company's financial performance.\n\nGold Evidences:\n- Operating profit is derived from net sales after deducting operating expenses.\n- The table provides net sales and operating profit figures for the years 2014, 2015, and 2016.\n- The context mentions changes in operating profit and net sales, indicating how they relate to each other.\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify the operating profit and net sales for each year from the table:\n   - 2014: Net Sales = $7092 million, Operating Profit = $1344 million\n   - 2015: Net Sales = $6770 million, Operating Profit = $1282 million\n   - 2016: Net Sales = $6608 million, Operating Profit = $1018 million\n\n2. Calculate operating expenses for each year using the formula:\n   - Operating Expenses = Net Sales - Operating Profit\n\n3. Perform the calculations:\n   - For 2014: \n     - Operating Expenses = 7092 - 1344 = $5748 million\n   - For 2015: \n     - Operating Expenses = 6770 - 1282 = $5488 million\n   - For 2016: \n     - Operating Expenses = 6608 - 1018 = $5590 million\n\n4. Analyze the relationship:\n   - Operating profit decreases as net sales decrease from 2014 to 2016.\n   - Operating expenses also fluctuate, indicating that they do not always decrease in line with net sales.\n\nConclusion: The relationship between operating profit, net sales, and operating expenses shows that while net sales and operating profit are directly related, operating expenses can vary independently, affecting overall profitability.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"Operating profit is calculated as net sales minus operating expenses, and they are interrelated in financial reporting.\"];"
