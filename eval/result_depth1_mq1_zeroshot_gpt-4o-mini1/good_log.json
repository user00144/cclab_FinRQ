        "socratic_answer": "To determine the portion of the total future minimum commitments under operating leases that is due in the next 36 months, we need to analyze the provided data.\n\n1. **Total Future Minimum Commitments**: The total future minimum commitments under operating leases is given as $1,203 million.\n\n2. **Breakdown of Commitments**:\n   - 2016: $134 million\n   - 2017: $133 million\n   - 2018: $131 million\n   - 2019: $125 million\n   - 2020: $120 million\n   - Thereafter: $560 million\n\n3. **Next 36 Months**: The next 36 months would cover the years 2016, 2017, and 2018. We will sum the commitments for these years:\n   - 2016: $134 million\n   - 2017: $133 million\n   - 2018: $131 million\n\n   Total for the next 36 months = $134 million + $133 million + $131 million = $398 million.\n\n4. **Portion of Total Commitments**: Now, we need to find out what portion of the total future minimum commitments this $398 million represents:\n   - Portion = (Total for next 36 months / Total future commitments) * 100\n   - Portion = ($398 million / $1,203 million) * 100\n\n5. **Calculating the Portion**:\n   - Portion = 0.3306 * 100 = 33.06%\n\nThus, the portion of the total future minimum commitments under operating leases that is due in the next 36 months is approximately 33.06%.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"33.06%\";].",
