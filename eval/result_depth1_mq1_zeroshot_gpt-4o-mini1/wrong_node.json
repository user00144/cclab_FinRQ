This implies that the increase in operating expenses due to fuel prices was $242 million.\n\n2. **Calculating Operating Expenses for 2006**: Since the increase in operating expenses for 2007 was $242 million, we can denote the operating expenses for 2006 as \\( X \\).

This can be expressed mathematically as:\n   \\[\n   X + 242 = 1.09X\n   \\]\n   Rearranging this gives:\n   \\[\n   242 = 1.09X - X\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   242 = 0.09X\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   X = \\frac{242}{0.09} \\approx 2688.89 \\text{ million}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating Total Operating Expenses for 2007**: Now substituting \\( X \\) back into the equation for operating expenses in 2007:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Expenses for 2007} = 2688.89 + 242 \\approx 2930.89 \\text{ million}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total operating expenses for 2007 are approximately $2930.89 million, and the 9% increase relates to the operating expenses in 2006, which were approximately $2688.89 million.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"$2930.89 million for 2007; $2688.89 million for 2006\"; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."

This figure is for the year 2004, and we need to consider the situation before the reverse stock split.\n3. The reverse stock split was a one-for-three split, which means that for every three shares held, shareholders would receive one share after the split.

Let the net interest income for 2016 be represented as X.\n2. According to the context, 2017's net interest income ($2.93 billion) is 13% higher than 2016's.\n3. Therefore, we can set up the equation: \n   \\[\n   2.93 = X \\times (1 + 0.13) \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2.93 = X \\times 1.13 \n   \\]\n4.

            "raw_answer": "To determine the total long-term debt amount as of December 31, 2012, we need to analyze the information provided in the context.\n\n1. The context states that as of December 31, 2011, the outstanding principal balance under long-term debt agreements was $14.5 million.\n2. It also mentions scheduled maturities of long-term debt for the years 2012 to 2016, with a total scheduled maturity of $77,724,000.\n3. The current maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2011, were $6,882,000, which would be subtracted from the total scheduled maturities to find the long-term debt obligations.\n4. The long-term debt obligations as of December 31, 2011, were stated to be $70,842,000.\n\nSince the question asks for the total long-term debt amount as of December 31, 2012, we can infer that the long-term debt amount would likely remain the same unless there were additional borrowings or repayments made during 2012. However, the context does not provide specific information about any changes in long-term debt during 2012.\n\nThus, based on the information available, the total long-term debt amount as of December 31, 2012, would be the same as the long-term debt obligations as of December 31, 2011.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"$70,842,000\"; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."

This totals to:\n   - $5,583,333 + $5,583,333 = $11,166,666.\n\n2. Additionally, it mentions that approximately $1.8 million of the remaining $11.2 million potential contingent payments must be made in cash. \n\n3. Therefore, the total contingent payments related to the Impella acquisition is $11,166,666, and the amount that must be paid in cash is $1.8 million.\n\nCombining these findings, we can conclude:\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"Total contingent payments: $11,166,666; Cash payments: $1.8 million\"; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."

            "raw_answer": "To determine the total amount spent by employees on the 2.2 million shares purchased in 2011, we need to refer to the purchase prices provided in the context.\n\nFrom the context, for the year ended December 31, 2011, employees purchased 2.2 million shares at purchase prices of $34.52 and $42.96. However, the context does not specify how many shares were purchased at each price. \n\nTo calculate the total amount spent, we can use the average of the two prices as an approximation. The average price can be calculated as follows:\n\nAverage price = (Price1 + Price2) / 2\nAverage price = ($34.52 + $42.96) / 2 = $38.74\n\nNow, we can calculate the total amount spent by multiplying the average price by the number of shares purchased:\n\nTotal amount spent = Average price * Number of shares\nTotal amount spent = $38.74 * 2,200,000 = $85,228,000\n\nThus, the total amount spent by employees on the 2.2 million shares purchased in 2011 is approximately $85.23 million.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"$85.23 million\"; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"middle\"]."

This indicates that there may be instances where revenue is recognized but cash has not yet been received, leading to discrepancies.\n\n2. **Impairment of Receivables**: It is stated that a receivable is considered impaired when it is probable that amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms. This impairment can lead to a situation where revenue is recognized, but the cash payment is not received, contributing to discrepancies.\n\n3. **Allowances for Doubtful Accounts**: The context discusses how additions to allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to current period earnings. This means that even if revenue is recognized, the actual cash flow may be affected by the need to account for potential uncollectible amounts.\n\n4. **Charge-offs**: The context explains that finance receivables are assessed for charge-off when they become significantly past due. This indicates that revenue may have been recognized earlier, but cash payments are not received, leading to discrepancies.\n\n5. **Inventory and Other Accrued Liabilities**: While the context provides information on inventories and accrued liabilities, it does not directly relate to cash payments and revenue recognition. However, it does highlight the complexity of financial reporting and the potential for discrepancies.\n\nBased on these points, the factors contributing to discrepancies between cash payments received and revenue recognized include the assessment of receivables, impairment of receivables, allowances for doubtful accounts, and charge-offs.\n\nThe final answer is [Answer: \"Factors include assessment of receivables, impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, and charge-offs.\"; Used hints: \"None\"; Confidence: \"high\"]."
